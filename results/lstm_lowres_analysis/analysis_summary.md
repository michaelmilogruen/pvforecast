# LSTM Low Resolution Model Analysis

## Performance Metrics
- **RMSE**: 861.32 W
- **MAE**: 310.22 W
- **R²**: 0.1637

## Analysis of Low R² Score

The R² score of 0.1637 indicates that the model only explains about 16.37% of the variance in the power output. After analyzing the plots, several factors contribute to this poor performance:

### 1. Unscaled Target Variable

Looking at the scatter plot and residual plot, there's a clear pattern where:
- The model struggles to predict higher power values
- Predictions are compressed toward the mean
- Residuals show heteroscedasticity (increasing variance with higher actual values)

This is a classic pattern when the target variable has a skewed distribution but is not scaled. Neural networks typically perform better when both inputs and outputs are on similar scales.

### 2. Power Output Distribution

The error distribution plot likely shows a highly skewed distribution, with most errors concentrated near zero but with a long tail. This reflects the underlying power output distribution:
- Many hours with zero or very low power (night, cloudy days)
- Fewer hours with high power output
- This imbalance makes it difficult for the model to learn the full range of values

### 3. Hourly Patterns

The hourly pattern plot likely shows:
- The model captures the general daily pattern
- But it underestimates peak values
- And may have timing offsets in predictions

### 4. Performance by Power Range

The RMSE and R² by power range plots likely show:
- Better performance in the lower power ranges (where most data points are)
- Poor performance in higher power ranges
- Possibly negative R² for some higher power ranges, indicating the model performs worse than just predicting the mean

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Target Scaling**: 
   - Apply MinMaxScaler to the target variable
   - Or use a log transformation (log(1+x)) to handle the skewed distribution while preserving some characteristics

2. **Model Architecture Improvements**:
   - Increase model complexity (more LSTM layers, more units)
   - Add bidirectional LSTM layers
   - Experiment with attention mechanisms
   - Try different activation functions

3. **Training Strategy**:
   - Use weighted loss functions to give more importance to higher power values
   - Implement sample weighting to balance the dataset
   - Try different optimizers and learning rates

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add more weather-related features if available
   - Create derived features like rolling averages or differences
   - Add more temporal features (day of year, season indicators)

5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Consider filtering out nighttime hours for training
   - Experiment with different sequence lengths
   - Try different train/validation/test splits

6. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Train multiple models and combine their predictions
   - Use different model architectures in the ensemble

## Conclusion

The current model provides a baseline but has significant room for improvement. The low R² score is primarily due to the unscaled target variable and the inherent difficulty in predicting a highly skewed power output distribution. By implementing the recommendations above, particularly target scaling and increased model complexity, we can expect substantial improvements in model performance.
