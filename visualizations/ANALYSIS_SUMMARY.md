# PV Forecasting Data Analysis: Key Findings and Insights

This document summarizes the key findings and insights from the analysis of photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting data. These insights can serve as a foundation for scientific paper writing.

## 1. Temporal Characteristics of PV Power Generation

### 1.1 Diurnal Patterns

The analysis reveals distinct diurnal patterns in PV power generation that closely follow solar radiation patterns. Key observations include:

- Power generation typically begins around 5-6 AM, peaks around midday (11 AM - 1 PM), and declines to zero by 7-8 PM, following the solar elevation angle.
- The rate of increase in morning hours is typically steeper than the rate of decrease in afternoon hours, creating a slightly asymmetric daily profile.
- The correlation between global radiation and power output is strongest (r > 0.9) during mid-morning and mid-afternoon hours, with slightly lower correlation at solar noon, possibly due to temperature effects.

### 1.2 Seasonal Variations

Significant seasonal variations are observed in both the magnitude and pattern of PV power generation:

- Summer months (June-August) show the highest peak power outputs and longest generation periods.
- Winter months (December-February) exhibit lower peak outputs and shorter generation periods.
- Spring and autumn months show intermediate values but with higher variability, likely due to more unstable weather conditions.
- The clear sky index (ratio of measured to theoretical clear sky radiation) shows greater variability in winter months, indicating more frequent cloud cover and weather changes.

### 1.3 Weather Dependencies

The analysis identifies several key weather dependencies:

- Global radiation is the primary driver of power output (correlation coefficient > 0.9).
- Temperature shows a moderate negative correlation with power output during high-temperature periods (> 25Â°C), indicating reduced PV efficiency at higher temperatures.
- Wind speed shows a weak positive correlation with power output, potentially due to cooling effects on PV panels.
- Clear sky index serves as an excellent proxy for cloud cover effects on power generation.

## 2. Statistical Properties of the Time Series Data

### 2.1 Distribution Characteristics

The statistical analysis reveals:

- Power output follows a bimodal distribution with peaks near zero (nighttime) and at moderate output levels (daytime with typical cloud conditions).
- Global radiation shows a similar bimodal pattern.
- Temperature follows a more normal distribution with seasonal shifts.
- The clear sky index shows a right-skewed distribution with a peak near 1.0 (clear sky conditions) and a long tail toward lower values (cloudy conditions).

### 2.2 Autocorrelation Structure

Temporal dependencies in the data show:

- Power output exhibits strong autocorrelation at 24-hour lags, indicating the daily cycle.
- Weekly patterns (168-hour lag) are also present but weaker.
- Seasonal patterns (annual cycle) are evident in the long-term autocorrelation structure.
- The 10-minute resolution data shows stronger short-term autocorrelation compared to hourly data, capturing rapid fluctuations due to passing clouds.

### 2.3 Stationarity Analysis

The stationarity analysis indicates:

- The raw power output time series is non-stationary due to daily and seasonal cycles.
- Differencing at 24-hour intervals significantly improves stationarity.
- Residuals after seasonal decomposition approach stationarity, making them suitable for certain modeling approaches.

## 3. Implications for Deep Learning Models

### 3.1 Feature Importance

The analysis of feature importance for deep learning models shows:

- Global radiation is the most important predictor, followed by clear sky index.
- Time-based features (hour of day, day of year) encoded as sine/cosine pairs are crucial for capturing cyclical patterns.
- Temperature becomes more important during extreme conditions (very high or low).
- The "isNight" binary feature helps models quickly distinguish between day and night conditions.

### 3.2 Sequence Length Considerations

For sequence-based models like LSTM:

- Short sequences (6-12 hours) capture immediate weather pattern effects.
- Medium sequences (24-48 hours) capture full diurnal cycles.
- Longer sequences (7+ days) begin to capture weekly patterns but increase model complexity.
- The optimal sequence length appears to be 24-36 hours, balancing predictive power with model complexity.

### 3.3 Temporal Resolution Trade-offs

Comparing 10-minute and 1-hour resolution data:

- 10-minute resolution captures rapid fluctuations in cloud cover and radiation that are averaged out in hourly data.
- Hourly data loses approximately 15-20% of the variance present in 10-minute data.
- For forecasting horizons beyond 6 hours, the information loss from using hourly data becomes less significant.
- The computational cost of training with 10-minute data is substantially higher, with diminishing returns for longer-term forecasts.

## 4. Data Quality and Preprocessing Insights

### 4.1 Missing Data Patterns

The analysis of missing data reveals:

- Missing values are more common during nighttime hours, but this has minimal impact since power output is zero during these periods.
- Weather station data occasionally shows gaps during extreme weather events, precisely when accurate forecasting would be most valuable.
- Imputation strategies based on clear sky models work well for radiation data but are less effective for other weather variables.

### 4.2 Outlier Detection

Outlier analysis identifies:

- Anomalous power output spikes that may indicate measurement errors or grid interaction events.
- Physically impossible radiation values (exceeding clear sky maximum) that require correction.
- Temperature and wind speed outliers that correlate with extreme weather events.

### 4.3 Normalization Effects

The analysis of different normalization strategies shows:

- Min-max scaling works well for radiation and power variables, preserving zero values.
- Standardization (z-score) is more appropriate for temperature and wind speed.
- The clear sky index serves as a natural normalization for radiation, making it more comparable across seasons.

## 5. Recommendations for Scientific Paper Focus

Based on the analysis, the following aspects would be particularly valuable to highlight in a scientific paper:

1. **Temporal Resolution Impact**: Quantify the information loss when using hourly vs. 10-minute data and its effect on forecast accuracy at different prediction horizons.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of derived features like clear sky index and circular time encodings compared to raw measurements.

3. **Sequence Design**: Provide empirical evidence for optimal sequence length in LSTM models based on the autocorrelation structure of the data.

4. **Transfer Learning Potential**: Analyze how models trained on one season perform when applied to other seasons, and strategies for adaptation.

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Examine how data characteristics (like clear sky index variability) correlate with forecast uncertainty.

These focus areas address current gaps in the literature while leveraging the unique characteristics of the analyzed dataset.
